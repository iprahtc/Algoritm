People in Great Britain like animals. There are even special hospitals, which help wild animals. There are a lot of television films about wildlife. They are very popular with children and grown ups. A lot of British families have 'bird tables' in their gardens. Birds can eat from them during the winter months. The 'bird table' should be high because cats can eat birds.
